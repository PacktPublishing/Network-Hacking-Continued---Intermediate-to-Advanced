# Network Hacking Continued - Intermediate to Advanced [Video]
This is the code repository for Network Hacking Continued - Intermediate to Advanced [Video](https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/network-hacking-continued-intermediate-advanced-video), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the video course from start to finish.

## About the Video Course
Welcome to this advanced network hacking course, designed to build up on what you already know about network hacking. It's recommended that you complete the network hacking section of the author's general ethical hacking course or finish his network hacking course before starting this course. Just like all of his other courses, this course is highly practical, whilst including the theory, but, since this is an advanced courseeach attack will be broken into its smaller components in order to understand how each of these components work; by the end of the course you will be able to mix these attacks and adopt attacks to suit different situations and different scenarios, and write your own man-in-the-middle scripts to implement your own man-in-the-middle attacks. Because this course builds on what you learn in the courses mentioned above, the main sections here have similar titles but the topics covered here are more advanced. Finally, at the end of the course, you will learn how to protect yourself and your systems from these attacks. All the attacks in this course are practical attacks that work against real computers. In each technique you will understand the theory behind it and how it works, then you'll learn how to use that technique in a real-life scenario, so by the end of the course you'll be able to modify these techniques or combine them to come up with more powerful attacks and adapt them to different scenarios and different operating systems.
